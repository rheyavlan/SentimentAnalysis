What the administration doesn\u2019t account for is the line running through the middle of Begum Jaan\u2019s(Vidya Balan) brothel situated plonk on the border; with one half falling in India and the other in Pakistan.  Begum Jaan Review: It\u2019s a good period and story to revisit because even 70-years after Partition, anything around it still piques interest. Then again, here the narrative deals less with the horror of the divide and serves more as an ode to the spiritedness of Begum; widowed in her childhood and sold to a brothel. Also, Mukherji is revisiting his Bengali film Rajkahini(2015).  movie  Coming back to our protagonist \u2013 kings, administrators and commoners are hooked onto the pleasures provided by her girls, so Begum with her guile manages to rule. Till, Radcliffe draws the Lakshman-Rekha.  Vidya invests fully in Begum and her dialogue-baazi (a lot of which is raunchy) will get ceetis. However, the writer-director\u2019s interest level in everything else, falters. A sense of deja-vu pervades as one watches a prostitute staring sightlessly at the celling when \"entertaining\" a customer; or when sex-workers get sentimental over a child, \"because all of them are mothers first and whores later.\" Surely these women needed to be fleshed out with more finesse.  Begum\u2019s spunk is infectious though. She resembles a Bengal tigress whether she is defending her body or boundaries. However, trying to retell her virtues through various historical avatars in animation, is far too indulgent. Also conversations between officials of the INC and Muslim League, or for that matter between other cardboard cutouts, is superficial. The cinematographer\u2019s effort to capture the Indo-Pak divide with close-ups in half frames, seems amiss.  The Holi number is peppy with striking visuals. Otherwise having the 11 women in one frame becomes nothing but a screech-fest. Having Vidya in a film is an asset though. She is an audacious actor, who merits an extra half star for her ability to shoulder a film.

Based on Diane Ackerman\u2019s book, the wartime drama pays tribute to the heroic Polish couple - Jan and Antonina Zabinski, former Warsaw zookeeper and his wife. The daring duo saved hundreds of Jews by sheltering them in the basement of their dilapidated zoo right under the noses of the Nazis, who bombed the place, killed the animals and shifted a few valuable species to Germany. Against all odds, the Warsaw zoo was rebuilt and is open till date.  Review: Niki Caro\u2019s suspenseful, awe-inspiring and captivating cinematic adaptation salutes the indomitable spirit of the Zabinskis, who exuded compassion, kindness and unflinching courage in the face of fear. It will compel you to visit the iconic zoo, which serves partially as a museum today. Powerful and gut-wrenching without an ounce of melodrama, the film tugs at your heartstrings and reinstates your belief in goodness and love towards other living being - be it man or animal.  It is the director\u2019s astute storytelling and ability to showcase varied human tendencies that allow her film to shuttle between a heartrending human drama and compelling war thriller. Every attempt of the couple, who put their lives on the line by indulging in guerrilla tactics against the Germans, sends shivers down your spine.  Quite emotional and therapeutic, tears roll down your cheeks when Antonina (played by Jessica Chastain) reveals why she loves animals. \u201cYou look into their eyes and you know exactly what's in their hearts\u201d, she says. Chastain\u2019s riveting portrayal and her comfort level with the animals is noteworthy. Especially the scenes where she plays the piano to warn the Jews hiding in her house are outstanding. Daniel Bruhl's intense performance as the German zoologist with suspicious intentions, lends gravitas to the period drama. The supporting cast is equally credible.  The Zookeeper's Wife is an incredible real life story that reminds us what makes us human - our ability to hope and rise beyond the darkness and hatred.

Tia succumbs to her injuries while Vidya survives. Since the police are dragging their feet all over the investigation, Vidya devises her own revenge strategy.  Maatr Review : Delhi, where this film is based is often referred to as the rape capital of India. And the film\u2019s sole intention is to serve as a wake-up call for the atrocities against women. So you applaud the intention. However, the film itself is over-dramatized account of the heinous crime and what follows.  Minutes into the movie, you see how a mother and daughter end up taking a wrong turn and unwittingly find themselves at the home of Apurva Malik (Madhur Mittal), the wayward son of a politician. High on substance, he and his gang of morally-depraved friends are ever ready to score. They rape and abuse Vidya and Tia in a brutal way, leaving you anguished. And, even before you can recover from the viciousness of it all, these two are flung from the car, onto the kerb in Nirbhaaya style, making you flinch further.  Obviously the idea is to get people out of their slumber but to achieve better results, the screenplay and characterization needed to be sharper. Instead it plays out like a drill. Mother is hospitalized. Her insensitive husband, mourns the loss of his daughter, but wants to divorce her. An artist friend, Ritu(Divya Jagdale) provides succour. And the police are stereotypes, who mouth ridiculous lines like, ``PM desh ko shape karne ki baat kar rahe hain, aur yeh rape ki baat kar rahi hai.\u2019\u2019  Next the mother, pulls off her bandages, steps on the treadmill and adorns the avenging angel avatar. Turn by turn, she plots the murders of the men who wronged her. Of course, because her suffering has been so deep, you empathize with her initially. However, her brand of vigilantism violence is equally disturbing.  Raveena is sincere as the victim who sullies her hands to get justice. But, the amount of bloodshed, leaves you asking, what is worse. Are the images of rape gorier, or is the bloodshed of the perpetrators of the crime, grosser?  ", "Sonata Story: Three intelligent, self-sufficient women debate companionship, compromises and compassion over wine, cheese and (sour) grapes.  Sonata Review: You\u2019d sooner see a flying saucer streak across the night sky than an Indian film with three 60-plus female protagonists who aren\u2019t playing doting mothers, dying aunts or devious matchmakers. Kudos to Aparna Sen for pulling this lost demographic out of the shadows.  In Sonata, a movie adaptation of Mahesh Elkunchwar\u2019s play, Sen casually invites us into the lives of three women in the their sunset years.  Aruna (Sen) is a linguistic scholar who won\u2019t stand foul language; she\u2019s comfortable living by the social code of a time whose scriptures she deciphers. While she\u2019s in her prudish cocoon, her long-time friend and roommate Dolon (Azmi) is the butterfly that Aruna never quite morphed into. Dolon is the little devil on Aruna\u2019s shoulder, always coaxing her into things that she\u2019s uncomfortable with. The movie thrives on the nervous energy between Aruna and Dolon. The possibility of a subtle romantic subtext there is intriguing and handled smartly. Their third friend Subi (Dubey) flits in and out of their house and gives them something to think about with every visit.  The movie has an unmissable Woody Allen influence, where the plot is merely a crutch to display well-rounded, vibrant characters. So while you cannot summarize the story, you can best describe it as an evening spent chatting with friends - you being the designated listener - where you are amused by Dolon\u2019s indecision, Aruna\u2019s meekness and Subi\u2019s bouts with her men.  And like all evenings with friends, there will be awkward silences when you will momentarily zone out when a character is droning about Beethoven, or an actor is delivering a heightened performance. In a play, this is charming. Sen hasn\u2019t quite altered the screenplay or the treatment to fit this new medium. Static shots and indulgent conversations are Sonata's bane.  However, it is rare for unapologetic narratives about older single women (who \"aren't even feminists!\") to find their way to the screen. This is the kind of movie that you need to sip and savour. It won\u2019t go well with popcorn and soda, but it\u2019s worth a visit to the theatre anyway.
