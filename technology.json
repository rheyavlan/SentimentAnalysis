Apple will launch the new iPhones in India on October 7. Though\n  Apple\n  has not yet officially started the pre-orders for the two phones, several resellers of the company like IWorld have already started accepting the pre-bookings for the device.\n  \n\n  Apple launched iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus in India in October last year. The Apple\n  iPhone\n  6s (16GB) launched at a price of Rs 62,000, while iPhone 6s Plus (16GB) had an MRP of Rs 72,000.\n  \n\n\nStrong iPhone 7 pre-orders from AT&T, Sprint help Apple shares soarUS wireless carriers Sprint Corp and T-Mobile US Inc said on Tuesday they received strong pre-orders for Apple Inc's iPhone 7, sending shares of the world's most valuable listed company up 3%.\n\n\n\n  Both the\n  iPhones\n  come with 3D Touch and 2GB RAM.

If you're a student or a young professional, chances are that you simply don't have enough to spare for the buy . While the former does not have regular channels of income, the latter may struggle to save enough after paying the bills. A convenient solution is to pay it off in EMIs. However, this is easier said than done, since bank loans come with their own set of conditions and in-store EMI schemes require credit cards and offer only limited options in terms of inventory .\n  \n\nFinomena, a startup with a unique system of verification and loan approval, offers an alternative. It is a customer-experience driven fintech platform that enables inclusion by offering easy access to credit for people who have never taken a loan before, and hence do not have a credit score.Moreover, it allows you to register online and simply browse ecommerce sites and choose the gadget you want.After that you can choose from the financing and EMI options and apply with a single click.\n  \n\nBanked but not eligible\n\n  The phrase 'financial inclusion' evokes the idea of a section of people without access to basic banking services. This is why one of the government's primary initiatives in facilitating financial inclusion has been to open bank accounts through the Jan Dhan Yojana. However, a bank account alone does not ensure access to credit. A section that gets largely left out in terms of access to loans and credit cards, despite holding bank accounts, includes students, young professionals and the self-employed.More than 75% of Indians do not have a traditional credit bureau score.\n  \n\n  \"We cannot rely too much on traditional models to gauge the credit score of a potential client as traditional data for these people doesn't exist.They might not have traditional income proof but with the power of a smartphone, they are leaving a massive digital footprint,\" says Abhishek Garg, cofounder, Finomena. The platform uses this big data to create machine learning-based risk and credit scoring systems that take into account over 20,000 data points to assess the credit worthiness of a borrower.\n  \n\n  Shashank Singh, 26, may be a lawyer at the Delhi High Court, but securing a loan from a bank was nearly impossible. \"As an advocate, my income fluctuates month to month , which is why banks are reluctant to issue credit cards to me or approve my loan applications,\" he says. When he wanted to purchase an iPhone 6S, Singh approached several banks for a loan, but was turned down each time. He started looking for alternatives and chanced upon Finomena. \"They had a one-on-one conversation with me about their processes, and sent someone to pick up the documents from my home. My loan was approved within a day,\" says Singh.\n  \n\nWhat's in a credit score?\n\n  A credit score is a three digit numeric summary of your entire credit history. It is prepared based on the information provided in your Credit Information Report. The credit score normally ranges between 300 and 900.Most banks and financial institutions rely on this figure to determine the credit worthiness of potential bor rowers. In fact, 79% of the loans approved are for individuals with a score over 750.\n  \n\n  However, this is a setback for the young unbanked population since they may not have a credit score at all, resulting in a vicious cycle.Finomena's founders, Riddhi Mittal and Abhishek Garg, did extensive research about loan disbursal mechanisms and the demographic of borrowers, which revealed that most banks and NBFCs steer clear of the students and young professionals because traditional modes of KYC data collection don't work for them. \"Most of our customers are in their first jobs, or self-employed with no traditional proof,\" says Mittal.\n  \n\nSpee\nd, convenience and flexibility\n\n  While there are a few options available to customers for buying high-end gadgets on an EMI basis, they often have hidden clauses. In-store EMI programmes require the customer to have a credit card. However, less than 2% Indians are credit card holders.These schemes also have set tenures and EMI amounts payable by the customer. Finomena has taken it one step further by introducing FMIs or flexible monthly installments.\n  \n\n  Viren Makwana, an IT student who also has a part-time job, was pleasantly surprised to learn that he could choose the down-payment amount, as well as how much he wanted to pay each month for buying a laptop.\n  \n\n  The 21-year-old settled for a monthly payment of Rs 2,000 to pay off the loan over a 12-month period.\n  \n\n  \"Initially I didn't believe that online EMIs were possible, but once I spoke to a Finomena representative, I was reassured that the process would work,\" he says.\n  \n\n", "\n\n  NEW DELHI: Anil Ambani-led Reliance Communications today agreed to merge its wireless\n  telecom\n  business with smaller rival Aircel to create the country's 4th-biggest mobile phone operator with asset base of more than Rs 65,000 crore.\n  \n\n  In the largest consolidation in the country's telecom sector, RCom and Aircel's majority owner, Malaysia's Maxis Communications Berhad (MCB), announced signing of definitive documents for the merger of their Indian wireless businesses.\n  \n\n  RCom and\n  Aircel\n  will hold 50 per cent each in the new company.

Whether you're a long-term fitness buff or just getting started on the path of getting into shape, a fitness tracker is one of the best gadgets one can get. These wrist-worn (generally) devices can not only track human body's vital signs like heart rate, but also log fitness-related data such as step count, calories burnt, sleep activity and more. This data can be then used to create personalized fitness goals and diet plans, thus leading to a healthier lifestyle.\n  \n\n  When it comes to fitness trackers,\n  Fitbit\n  is a name that needs no introduction. The company recently launched two new products - Charge 2 and Flex 2. Of these, the more expensive Charge 2 is an upgrade to the Fitbit Charge HR, which is now almost two years old.\n  \n\n  We tested the Fitbit Charge 2 for a few days, using it for tracking everything from sleeping patterns to daily walks. So, is the Fitbit Charge 2 and its promise of a healthier lifestyle any good, especially at an asking price of Rs 14,999? Let's find out.\n  \n\n\n\n\nDesign and build quality\n\n\n  Fitbit Charge 2 is essentially comprises two components - tracker module and wrist band. The wrist band is made from a flexible elastomer material and comes with a stainless-steel buckle for fastening the Charge 2 around the wrist. The outer side of the band is textured, while the underside is smooth. The\n  wrist band\n  is removable and can be swapped with one of the many designer bands, which have to be purchased separately. Since it's sweat proof, the wrist band doesn't irritate the skin even when the Charge 2 is worn on the wrist for an extended period of time.\n  \n\n  As for the tracker module itself, its frame is made from stainless steel. On the top rests a slightly curved black glass, under which hides a large (at least as compared to the Charge HR)\n  OLED\n  display. The left and right sides of the frame are chamfered and a navigation button lies on the left, the only button on the Fitbit Charge 2.\n  \n\n\n\n\n  Flip the Charge 2 and you see the optical heart rate tracker with two flashing LEDs (one each at the top and bottom of the tracking chip). There are also three charging contacts at the bottom, which work by making contact with the pins on the clip-on charger. Other important components include a 3-axis accelerometer, an altimeter and a vibration motor.\n  \n\n  Overall, we found the design and build quality of the Fitbit Charge 2 to be really good. While the tracker module is quite solid, the wrist band is flexible yet sturdy enough to withstand daily wear and tear.\n  \n\nREAD ALSO:\nREAD ALSO:\n    Fitbit Charge 2 and Flex 2 launched, price starts at Rs 9,499\n\n\n\nDisplay and navigation\n\n\n  Fitbit Charge 2 comes with a touch-capable OLED\n  screen\n  that automatically turns on when the wearer flicks the wrist, although this functionality can be disabled in the Fitbit app. The display can also be turned on with a double-tap or by pressing the navigation button on the side.\n  \n\n  Though the display shows time and date by default, users also have the option to choose from the various styles available. To change the display style, simply select it from the 'Clock Display' option in the Fitbit\n  app\n  and sync the tracker with the app. The display can be single-tapped repeatedly to flip through daily activity stats like calories burnt and floors climbed.\n  \n\n\n\n\n  As for the navigation, pressing the navigation button on the left repeatedly moves through various menu options (e.g. Heart Rate, Stopwatch). While a menu item is active, its related options can be cycled through by tapping the display. Lastly, long-pressing the side navigation button starts/stops the function associated with a menu item (e.g. Run).\n  \n\n  Interestingly, on-screen options can also be shuffled through by tapping anywhere on the wristband.\n  \n\nTracking performance and companion app\n\n\n  Fitbit Charge 2 works in tandem with the Fitbit app (available on all platforms). You also need to create a free Fitbit account (if you don't already have one) to login to the app. The account/profile creation includes entering essential body statistics like weight and height, as these are required for setting up personalized meal plans and weight goals.\n  \n\n  Once you login with your Fitbit account, it's generally easy to pair the Charge 2 with the smartphone over\n  Bluetooth\n  using the app. But sometimes, the tracker does take a bit of a trial-and-error to get paired up. After pairing, you can simply wear the Charge 2 on the wrist (it can be worn on either of the wrists) and it will start doing its thing. The tracker syncs with the smartphone over Bluetooth every time the app is launched. It can be manually synchronized as well. Also, the smartphone that Fitbit Charge 2 is paired with needs to be connected to a network so that logged data can be synchronized to your Fitbit\n  account\n  .\n  \n\n\n\n\n  The 'Dashboard' is the default landing section of the app. It displays a summarized list of all the metrics that are tracked by Fitbit Charge 2, including steps walked, calories burnt, floors climbed and sleep activity. Tapping on any logged parameter gives its logged values for the past days, with the last week's data arranged in the form of a bar graph.\n  \n\n  The primary daily goal is set to steps by default, but can be changed via the tracker\n  settings\n  in the app. All data logs reset automatically at the start of the next day (00:00 hrs).\n  \n\n  During our extensive testing spanning over the course of almost a week (which included wearing the device almost 24x7), we found the Fitbit Charge 2 to be really good at logging different parameters. It detects activities like sleeping automatically and heart rate tracking is reliably accurate. Moreover, step logging is almost real-time.\n  \n\nREAD ALSO:\nREAD ALSO:\n    Fitbit rolls out software update, launches Special Edition Gold series Alta and Blaze\n\n\n\n  Fitbit Charge 2 comes with 'guided breathing sessions' (2min or 5min in length) feature. It lets you practice relaxed breathing by guiding you through inhale and exhale actions. This is something we liked a lot.\n  \n\n  There's also multi-sport tracking built-in. It can track activity when you're lifting weights, running on the treadmill, cycling or even working out generally. All this data is then synced to the companion\n  app\n  . In our testing, multi-sport tracking worked as expected.\n  \n\n  One feature we'd like to talk about is 'move reminders'. To help you stay through the entire day, Fitbit Charge 2 vibrates on an hourly basis, encouraging you to take at least 250 steps (roughly equivalent to a few minutes of walking). Of course, the reminders can be customized from the tracker's settings in the app.\n  \n\n\n\n\n  Fitbit Charge 2's 'connected GPS' functionality uses the GPS in your smartphone (provided it's the same the tracker is paired with) to track your route, thus helping in getting real-time statistics like distance travelled. During our testing, the feature worked quite well. That said, how accurate it is depends on numerous factors such as the quality of\n  GPS\n  satellite lock-in and the connection between the smartphone and tracker.\n  \n\n  If any of your friends uses a Fitbit fitness tracker, you can compare your fitness stats and take part in challenges together. However, we weren't able to test this feature out.\n  \n\n  A really useful feature of the Fitbit Charge 2 is smartphone notifications. These include alerts about calls, text messages (SMS, WhatsApp and Hangouts) and calendar events. In our testing, notifications worked exceptionally well. Consequently, we had to check our smartphone less often. But even with that, we found the alerts functionality to be limited. Competing products like the\n  Garmin\n  vivosmart HR are much better in this regard, offering not only email and social media alerts, but also the ability to control music playback and some other devices.\n  \n\n  Coming to the\n  battery\n  life, we found it to be really good. Fitbit claims that the Charge 2 can last up to five days on a single charge and indeed, the battery lasted about four and a half days (even with 24x7 tracking) before needing to be recharged.\n  \n\n\n\n\nVerdict\n\n\n  The new Fitbit Charge 2 ticks nearly all the right boxes. It's comfortable for wearing all-day, supports real-time tracking of numerous activities and the notification alerts are all good. But there are a few negatives too, such as the often inconsistent\n  Bluetooth\n  syncing and the lack of music control functionality.\n  \n\n  At Rs 14,999, we'd say that Fitbit Charge 2 is a pretty solid and well-rounded fitness tracker and definitely recommended. For those looking at alternatives, the Garmin vivosmart HR is a great option.\n  \n\n", "\n\n  NEW DELHI: Telecom operator\n  Reliance Communications\n  today posted 5.8% rise in consolidated net profit to Rs 54 crore for the three-month period ended June 30.\n  \n\n  Anil Ambani-led RCom, which today agreed to merge its wireless telecom business with smaller rival Aircel to create the country's fourth-biggest mobile phone operator had posted a net profit of Rs 51 crore in the same period a year ago.\n  \n\n  The consolidated total income from operations declined by 4.7% to Rs 5,259 crore in the reported quarter from Rs 5,521 crore it posted in corresponding period a year ago.\n  \n\n  \"Results for quarter impacted by migration of CDMA customers to 4G LTE.
