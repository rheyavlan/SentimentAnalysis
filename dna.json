        	"content": "The merger's fallout will be a loss of one (or both) iconic brands and the ad campaigns that built the two brands\nBy the time you read this piece, you might also read that Vodafone and Idea have merged into one mammoth telecom company.\n The implications of the merger will be manifold: job losses (as duplication will be weeded out), efficiencies (as the new entity takes stock of common resources such as towers), added reach (as the new entity will take advantage of the unique reach of each of the original partners) and so on.\n But the tragedy will be the loss of one (or both) of the extraordinary brands built over decades and the entertaining and effective communication built by Vodafone (in its various avatars, from Hutchison Max, Orange and Vodafone) and Idea.\nFrom the days of the heady and soft 'You and I' campaign when the pug first said hello to viewers, to the extraordinary ZooZoos, peppered with some offbeat films for cobranded Vodafone-Facebook and Vodafone-BlackBerry, the Ogilvy Vodafone partnership has built a formidable brand while delighting consumers - even when the consumer was unhappy with the coverage or service from the telco.\n The 'What an Idea, Sirjee' campaign by Lowe Lintas is the foundation that built the brand Idea Cellular, featuring Abhishek Bachchan in his most successful role to date.\n The exposure for Abhishek Bachchan in the Idea films is perhaps greater than his cumulative exposure in Bollywood films.\nThe new entity will, one presumes, be new.\n Which means that both brands will die and, with the deaths, the advertising created thus far will die as well.\nThat is a huge loss to advertising.\n The common thread that binds both the successful Vodafone and Idea work is the relationship that the two telcos built with their advertising agency partners.\n In both instances, the advertising agencies were trusted partners in brand-building, extensions of the marketing teams in these companies.\n It is this spirit of partnership that allowed Ogilvy the license (and the budgets) to create the ZooZoos and for Lowe to take the 'movement' route with What an Idea, Sirjee.\nThe marketing teams at both Vodafone and Idea have changed many times over the years, but it is the continuity of the relationship with their agencies that has allowed them to create impactful advertising despite the changes.\n Who will be responsible for the advertising after the merger? Both Ogilvy and Lowe have invested heavily in resources on these accounts and been remunerated handsomely as well.\n The loss of an account such as this will be a blow, both in terms of revenue and in the opportunity to do good work.\n Will the work go to Ogilvy? To Lowe? Or will it be shared, in a new and unusual arrangement?\nOr will the new entity call a pitch and invite a host of other agencies to present their ideas? We have no answers, but we can say that the new advertising will be different from what either of the agencies has created so far - and that a new marketing team will emerge at Vodafone-Idea.\n What the new entity needs to do is to look hard at the value that resides in the relationships between the erstwhile companies and their agencies - and not waste this wealth.\nWhile Ogilvy and Lowe undoubtedly know how to create communication, there is an additional value.\n Having spent, in both cases, more than two decades with their clients, Ogilvy and Lowe have a rich understanding of the mobile services business and the consumers of this business.\nThey know what makes these consumers tick, what makes them smile and what makes them write cheques.\n And they can replace the pug, create another ZooZoo and get another great idea, sirjee.\n",

BKD has a very valid and strong message about equal rights and even touches upon the subject of dowry in a progressive manner.\n However, the vibe of the film isn't preachy or serious thanks to Shashank Khaitan's vibrant direction and the lead pair who manages to keep you invested in most of the film.\nWhat's hot:Despite being light and breezy, BKD has some heavy duty scenes that allow Varun and Alia to showcase their acting chops.\n Both have already established their versatility in different genres, which makes their performances in BKD even more endearing.\n As the naive, bumbling village buffoon in the first half Varun engages you with his goofiness.\n It doesn't take him too long to change gear and show his serious side in the second half as the narrative takes a dramatic turn.\n Badri is a likeable guy and Varun goes all out to ensure we are by his side.\n His comic timing with his sidekick (Sahil Vaid) is as good as his chemistry with Alia in the romantic scenes Varun's restraint in the climax scene is worth a applause, when he could have easily succumbed to the temptation of going all out and making it caricaturish.\n Alia is her usual self, which means she's damn good! Be it her accent or scenes with Varun, she proves yet again why she can take on any role and make it her own.\n Sahil Vaid as the accomplice in his love story deserves a special mention.\n Tamma Tamma looks good on the big screen and the soundtrack lends the right melody to the story.\nWhat's not:Mid way through the film, you get a sense of been there seen that.\n Varun-Alia's pairing is terrific, but the novelty is missing.\n Scenes of auditioning a bridegroom for a bride seem dated.\n Also the second half gets a bit lazy before leading to a very predictable climax.\n There are moments when you wish the screenplay had something more to offer.\n Varun and Alia's hinterland accents take some time to get used to.\n Vaidehi and Badri are from Kota and Jhansi, which aren't necessarily small towns, yet their characters seem too urban in terms of their look and styling.\nWhat to do:Badrinath Ki Dulhania is light, entertaining and likeable.\n Varun Dhawan and Alia Bhatt prove that on screen chemistry can be enough sometimes to keep you engaged in an average plot with a predictable narrative.\nRating: *** (3 stars)\n",

        	"content":"Karan Johar questions the definition of love, Ranbir-Anushka are delightful\nWHAT'S IT ABOUT:As relationships get more complicated in the real world, trust filmmakers to add those complexities on celluloid too.\n Karan Johar's latest film poses several questions on the definition of love.\n Ayan (Ranbir Kapoor) and Alizeh (Anushka Sharma) meet at a bar.\n After a failed attempt at making out, they hang out, drink, laugh, talk and become friends.\n Soon enough, he falls in love with her but she is in love with another.\n They part ways when Alizeh marries her true love.\n Meanwhile, Ayan tried to move on with the sexy Saba (Aishwarya Rai Bachchan) but that doesn't work out either.\n Fate brings him back with Alizeh but nothing much has changed.\n She still doesn't want a romance and he still hasn't given up.\n But this time, there is a tragic lining that hangs over their friendship.\n How Ayan and Alizeh cope with it and their relationship forms the rest of the story.\nWHAT'S HOT:There's always something new to expect from every Karan Johar film.\n This time, he questions the definition of love.\n There is also the emphasis on one-sided love and to Johar's credit, he handles it with maturity.\n He captures the friendship between Ayan and Alizeh brilliantly - without letting Ayan's attraction for her spoil the relationship.\n The moments are real and the setting (London, Vienna and Paris) is filled with romance.\n The winter look adds to the beauty of the film.\n ADHM is conversational, intimate, complex and fierce in terms of its approach towards love.\n Ranbir Kapoor is a delight on screen, no matter what he does.\n From dancing to Jeetendra's songs to doing Sunny Leone's steps from 'Babydoll', he is magic on screen.\n When he cries in 'Channa Mereya', you cry with him. But ADHM belongs to Anushka Sharma who delivers her most nuanced performance.\n As Alizeh, her sincerity is so severe that she steals every frame she is a part of.\n This performance clearly establishes her as the finest actor of her generation.\n Aishwarya Rai Bachchan looks stunning and is excellent despite not having much to do.\n Lisa Haydon is absolutely adorable as bimbette, making you wonder why we don't see more of her.\nWHAT'S NOT:Karan Johar always tells beautiful love stories and presents his actors wonderfully.\n But no actor in his film has ever risen above the script, or been let down by it.\n When you leave the theatre after watching a KJo film, you remember the songs, the scenes and moments that make you laugh and cry.\n In ADHM, you leave the theatre carrying just Ranbir's heartache and Anushka's performance.\n This film could easily be Karan Johar's tribute to Imtiaz Ali (with a nod to Farah Khan courtesy all the 'I-love-Bollywood' moments).\n The first half is similar to Tamasha and the second half, Rockstar.\n Unfortunately both those films also starred Ranbir Kapoor, so there is a sense of deja vu.\n It's all very well to make fun of Hindi films from the 80s, but then you can't have your protagonists dancing to synchronized steps with foreign background dancers in a disco in London.\n Sadly, the continuity jerks also are far too many.\n When Alizeh wants to take the heartbroken Ayan home, she asks him for his address and then she takes him to her house when he is too drunk to tell her.\n But she has been in his house before. Also, when she is leaving Paris for London, she is shown desperately trying to pack things into a red bag.\n But she leaves the hotel with just a backpack. Alizeh play-acting the dramatic Hindi TV serial heroine is straight out of Tees Maar Khan.\n Ranbir Kapoor's filmi dance moves in another song will take you into a flash from Bachna Ae Haseeno.\n KJo's films are always KJo's films. This one seems heavily borrowed, diluting the overall impact.\n The biggest letdown is that despite all the focus on relationships, the film lacks the capacity to choke you with emotion.\n The only one that comes close is when Ayan and Alizeh waltz on Lag Jaa Galey and that too because of the inherent emotional value of the classic song.\n",

In frock-style swim wear, arms and legs often concealed in something that is a cross between scuba gear and a burkini.\nHer body language: Apologetic. She is almost sorry for being there, and would rather remain under water than emerge for air.\nThere are a million invisible lines of power in our community pools.\nThey start with separate timings for men and women.\nThe AIMs, it is presumed, have professional commitments and hence need to use the pool before the women.\nThe Ladies Exclusive timings are later in the day \u2014 well after the men have left for work and the kids for school.\nIt is often around noon, under the blistering sun.\nIt is perhaps a little different in upscale gated communities.\nThe pool is usually open to all, at all times of the day. Even then, it is not uncommon to spot the alpha male, showing us how to use a certain kind of body language while marking territory in water.\nI wonder if this confidence comes from the knowledge that most women, irrespective of their conditioning and confidence, tend to take up lesser space wherever they go.\nThey sit elegantly, legs crossed. They swim gracefully \u2014 yes even your average thunder-thighs aunty can show you how to master the dive, the butterfly and backstroke without making too much of a splash.\nOn the dance floor, they move in concentric circles, even as their men make drunken squiggles on the floor.\nWhich is why, Vidya Balan\u2019s big body language \u2014 legs spread, arms on knees, piercing gaze \u2014 in an upcoming film is so much about a woman\u2019s sexual expression and identity than just a brothel owner making a statement.\nMaybe this poolside gender role-play also has something to do with our collective fantasies.\nThe pool, in popular imagination, has been where men have had the best of everything.\nA soft Turkish robe, chilled beer, leggy women pawing him, rubbing sunscreen on his chest and a cartel of substances that boosted his already inflated ego.\nWomen, unless they were professional swimmers, would get into the pool only for his pleasure.\nAn idea reinforced by 007 and Ajit the Loin.\nWhich could also explain why the AIM is so insistent on taking selfies at every goddamned pool he meets \u2014 at resorts, hotels, clubs.\nHis FB or Insta feeds will even have pictures of unused pools where he lounges in his blue reflector sunglasses and chaddis.\nAnd so while I slip into a regulation swim wear and stick to my end of the pool, I watch the boys, men on the other side, taking up more than their share of space \u2014 both physical and otherwise.\nI wonder if they know I am judging them.

One of the best I have been a part of.\n Credit to India, they are a fantastic cricket side, particularly in their backyard.\n If you give them a sniff, they will take that,\" the Australian skipper said.\nBefore the start of the series, many predicted that the Smith-led young Australian side will be whitewashed by the Indians.\n But the visitors showed tremendous fighting spirit and managed to surprise with their resolute performances, quite creditable given that they didn't have a lot of experience of playing in the sub-continent.\n\"For Australia, this is the toughest conditions for us.\n To challenge them so much, I am proud. A lot of people wrote us off.\n They said it was going to be a 4-0 whitewash. I am proud of the way we have competed.\n We have probably let a few moments slip,\" Smith said. \"Against India you can't do that.\n The middle session yesterday, when you lose five for 70, you put yourself behind.
