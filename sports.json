The New Zealand captain made his first appearance in IPL X a memorable one for Sunrisers Hyderabad as they added Delhi Daredevils to the list of teams that succumbed to the hosts' never-say-die attitude.\n  \n\n  In doing a David Warner, Williamson showed that he's a consummate professional and his 89 (51b, 4x6, 6x5) was sheer class. Coach Tom Moody had lavished praise on the New Zealander ahead of the game, saying how he's such a positive influence on the team and how he's of immense help to Warner with his leadership abilities.\n  \n\n  The Sunrisers' skipper had a rare off day after winning the toss and batting first against Delhi on the same wicket where they had walloped Royal Challengers Bangalore in the opener.\n  \n\n  An express delivery from Chris Morris got rid of Warner, but that was the only success Delhi had for the next 14 overs as man of the match Williamson, one of the two changes Sunrisers made to the team that defeated Kings XI Punjab, assumed charge.\n  \n\nShikhar Dhawan (70; 50b, 4x7, 6x1) had a headstart of seven runs when the New Zealand captain came in to bat on Wednesday and the way he dominated the Delhi attack enthralled the crowd at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium - the 15-run win was the Sunrisers' fourth win at this venue this season.\n  \n\n  Morris' second over fetched 10 runs for the hosts, Angelo Mathews' first went for 16, a Pat Cummins' screamer was creamed over square leg and the 14th over bowled by Amit Mishra went for 19 runs, as Williamson shifted gears.\n  \n\n  The hosts couldn't have asked for a better No.3 whose authentic cricketing shots, brisk running between the wickets, and 136-run partnership with Dhawan put Sunrisers on course for 191 for four.\n  \n\n  It took a good catch by Shreyas Iyer off Morris, the only successful bowler for Delhi with four for 26, to dismiss Williamson, but Sunrisers, who had cruised to 80 for one at the halfway stage, added 55 in the next five and another 56 in the last five.\n  \n\n  The second change Hyderabad made also worked well. With 62 wickets from 21 matches, Mohd Siraj is one of the top wicket-takers in domestic season 2016-17 and he had topper Siddarth Kaul (67 from 21 games) for company.\n  \n\n  Sam Billings hit Siraj for three boundaries but the bowler had the last laugh. Sanju Samson (42; 33b, 4x2, 6x2) and Karun Nair (33; 23b, 5x4, 6x1) added 71 for the second as Delhi cruised to 56 for one in the first six overs and hardly looked in trouble till Nair was run out and Rishabh Pant succumbed soon after.\n  \n\n  Samson's dismissal soon after the strategic timeout, meant Delhi needed 65 from the last 30 deliveries, but they only mustered 176 for five.\n  \n\n  The 70-run fifth wicket partnership between Shreyas Iyer (50 no; 31b, 5x4, 6x2) and Mathews (31; 23b, 4x2, 6x1) whittled it down to 34 from the last 12 deliveries. But Bhuvneshwar was as usual brilliant in the penultimate over, conceding 10 runs, and for the second successive game, Kaul sealed the win with a remarkable final over.\n  \n\n", "\n\n  NEW DELHI: In a high-octane second week of matches (April 13-19) in IPL 2017, we've seen a tremendous display of accurate and incisive pace bowling from Purple Cap holder Bhuvneshwar Kumar, a heroic 95 from Manan Vohra, hat-tricks from Samuel Badree and IPL debutant Andrew Tye (who converted his into a five-wicket haul), a match-turning 70 from Kieron Pollard and a whirlwind return to form by Chris Gayle who in the process became the first batsman to 10,000 runs in Twenty20 cricket.\n  \n\n  But for his consistency and contribution to table-toppers Kolkata Knight Riders' hat-trick of victories this past week, there is no looking past the all-sorts spinner Sunil Narine. Three wickets in three matches at a superb economy rate of 4.75 puts Narine as the stand-out spin bowler of the past week of matches, and there was also a match-winning innings when the West Indian was promoted to open the innings with his skipper Gautam Gambhir versus Kings XI Punjab, which fetched Narine the Man-of-the-Match award.\n  \n\n  In the aforementioned match against KXIP, Narine had figures of 4-0-19-1 out of a total of 170/9. He bowled his first over during the Powerplay and conceded eight runs, and then came back to bowl the eighth and cramped Marcus Stoinis for room before drawing a fatal shot that cannoned into the stumps. In four overs spread apart across the fifth and 16th overs of KXIP's innings, Narine bowled 14 dot balls and did not concede a single boundary.\n  \n\n  Sent in as a pinch-hitter in the absence of the injured Chris Lynn, Narine found the boundary seven times - three sixes and four fours - during an electric 37 off 18 balls that gave KKR an opening stand of 76 in just 5.4 overs. A target of 171 was achieved for the loss of two wickets inside 17 overs, and the two-time champions were up and running.\n  \n\n  Two days later, Narine was at the forefront of another win, this one over defending champions Sunrisers Hyderabad. He failed as opener, scoring six of nine balls, but was excellent with the ball with figures of 4-0-18-1. Varying his pace and hitting a scrambled seam repeatedly, Narine befuddled the batsmen and in his third over - the 14th over of SRH's chase - he had Deepak Hooda stumped. In his four overs, Narine conceded one four and sent down 10 dot deliveries. KKR won by 17 runs, and when you consider that Umesh Yadav conceded nine runs an over, Trent Boult 8.25 and Chris Woakes 12.25, Narine's economy of 4.50 is stunning.\n  \n\n  In KKR's third won in a row, over Delhi Daredevils by four wickets off the penultimate delivery of the match, Narine was again outstanding with an analysis of 4-0-20-1. On a sluggish Feroz Shah Kotla surface, he wheeled away his four overs for in what was his most teasing display so far, and should have a second wicket if not for a dropped catch by Robin Uthappa behind the stumps. In two overs inside the Powerplay, Narine gave away eight runs while bowling four dots. In the 18th over, he duped big-hitting Angelo Mathews who was bowled when dashing out.\n  \n\n  Success for a winning team over a period of time is critical in assessing performances in a tournament as condensed as the IPL, and hence Narine edges out the other star performers of the past seven days.\n  \n", "\n\n  NEW DELHI: Sunrisers Hyderabad beat Delhi Daredevils by 15 runs to register their fourth straight win at home this IPL. Needing 192 to win, Sunrisers Hyderabad finished on 176 for 5 with Siddharth Kaul bowling a magnificent final over, conceding just eight off it and winning the match for his side.\n  \n\n  We break down the match in five different passages of play that determined the outcome.\n  \n\nWhere was Kane Williamson all this while?\n\n\n  ...Is the first question that comes to mind when you consider the kind of knock the New Zealand skipper played. Playing his first game of this IPL, Williamson scored a refined half-century. He walked in at No. 3, ahead of Moises Henriques and when Sunrisers had lost David Warner cheaply. The Delhi bowlers kept Williamson and Dhawan quiet with some disciplined bowling from Zaheer Khan and Pat Cummins. But once the Powerplay concluded, Williamson got Sunrisers moving with consecutive sixes off Angelo Mathews.\n  \n\n  On a slow surface, he paddled Zaheer towards the fine-leg boundary and drilled Pat Cummins past him. His real assault came against Amit Mishra. The legspinner tossed it up and Williamson gave himself room and used his feet to launch him over the fence twice in three balls. With Zaheer mixing it up, Williamson shuffled and whipped one behind square. It was ball-striking at its best. Not all timing and muscle but just about enough to get the job done. Williamson looked set to notch up the second individual three-figure digit of this season, but a terrific effort on the field by Shreyas Iyer ended his knock for 89.\n  \n\nDhawan gets some form going\n\n\n  Shikhar Dhawan, despite scoring a couple of 40s in the tournament, hadn't looked at his free-flowing best. But it happened here against the Daredevils. He and Williamson put on a 136-run stand for the second wicket and did the intelligent part of playing himself in. Dhawan quietly went about scoring runs when all the focus remained on Williamson and how easily he was belting the Daredevils bowlers. Dhawan brought up his 27th IPL half-century soon after his partner notched up his. He played the anchor role well.\n  \n\n  It wasn't as if Dhawan was slow. He began with a four after the first ball of the match resulted in a free hit and hit a couple of delightful cover drives off Cummins and Morris. A period of lull followed but whenever the opportunity arrived, Dhawan punished the loose balls. Once he went past his fifty, the left-hander put Morris for two boundaries in the 17th over and cleared the midwicket boundary off a Mathews' delivery that was right in the slot. He fell to an awful Morris delivery, one that was way down leg. Dhawan swung and the ball went straight down Mathews' throat at deep-square leg.\n  \n\nNo stopping Morris\n\n\n  Chris Morris continues to amaze. Having already registered figures of 3/21 against Royal Challengers Bangalore and 3/23 against Kings XI Punjab, the South African allrounder delivered once again - this time his second best IPL figures of 2/26 in four overs. He provided Daredevils the perfect start, sending back Warner in the second over, and then returned for his second spell in the 17th over to remove the dangerous Williamson. In his next and final over, Morris pinned Dhawan and Yuvraj off successive deliveries to deny Sunrisers a final thrust. Even though Deepak Hooda and Moises Henriques' small cameos towards the end ensured that Sunrisers got to 191/4, without Morris, they could have very well breached the 200 barrier or even more.\n  \n\nSamson, Nair keep chase in control before Yuvraj gamble pays off\n\n\n  Mohammed Siraj, the debutant, after getting hit for three fours in his first over, got his man Sam Billings. It was an uppish flick but was hit straight to Hooda at mid-wicket. But despite the wicket, Sanju Samson and Karun Nair kept the scoreboard moving at a brisk pace. It was a wonderful Powerplay for the Daredevils as they race to 56/1 in six overs. Samson cracked a couple of sixes, while Nair played a few lovely cover drives and finally seemed to be getting some runs under his belt. 20 off his first 25 runs came in boundaries. The two put on 71 runs and at 75/1, Sunrisers seemed to be in control of the proceedings.\n  \n\n  The Daredevils then took a gamble when they handed the ball to Yuvraj Singh, and it paid off. His first ball went for a four but off the second, Vijay Shankar put in a powerful throw from the deep to run Nair out. Three balls later, Rishabh Pant slog swept Yuvraj to find Warner at long-on. The double blow shifted the tide in favour of Sunrisers.\n  \n\nIyer fights, but Kaul prevails\n\n\n  With Samson perishing and 91 needed off the final six, it was time to go for the big shots, and Iyer began doing so with a couple of sixes off Rashid Khan. But some terrific bowling by Moises Henriques, Siraj and then Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Siddharth Kaul in the death was too much for even Iyer to overcome. Daredevils might have missed a trick by sending Mathews ahead of Morris, who never got a chance to bat. Iyer fought hard, and his unbeaten 50 off 31 balls - five fours and two sixes - brought the equation down to 24 needed off the final over. But Kaul held his nerves to bowl a fabulous final over, where he conceded just eight and won his side the match by 15 runs.\n  \n", "\nCristiano Ronaldo asked for immunity from the boos of the ever-demanding Santiago Bernabeu crowd after his hat-trick against Bayern Munich on Tuesday fired Real Madrid into the semi-finals of the Champions League for a seventh consecutive season.\n  \n\n  Ronaldo's double in Munich had given Real a 2-1 lead in the first leg and after a couple of wayward shots in the first half had provoked whistles from the home supporters, the prolific Portuguese proved the difference in an eventual 4-2 win over Bayern after extra-time, setting up a 6-3 aggregate victory.\n  \n\n  His header cancelled out Robert Lewandowski's goal late in the second half and he then finished off Bayern with strikes in either half of extra-time after Sergio Ramos' own goal had levelled the scores on aggregate, although his last two goals were from offside positions.\n  \n\n  His third goal of the night and fifth of the tie saw him become the first player to reach 100 goals in the Champions League, and the four-times World Player of the Year put his finger to his lips to the supporters who had booed him earlier.\n  \n\n  \"I'm not asking them to name streets after me, the only thing I ask is that they don't boo me here,\" Ronaldo told Spanish TV station Antena 3.\n  \n\n  \"I want them to stop booing me because I always give my best and even when I don't score I try to help Real Madrid.\"\n  \n\n  Manager Zinedine Zidane lavished praise on the team's all-time top scorer but reminded Ronaldo that Real players had to get used to the relentless pressure from supporters of the 11-time European champions.\n  \n\n  \"Perhaps the fans won't boo him any more, but this is the Bernabeu and it can happen from time to time and he knows that,\" said the former France captain.\n  \n\n  \"The only thing he did was to stay calm and he proved himself on the pitch. There are few players that are always there in the key moments, and the fans will be grateful for what Cristiano has done here.\n  \n\n  \"He always knows that when there's an important occasion, he's going to be there and he showed it again tonight. What he did is outside any sort of category. There are few players who can do what Ronaldo has done and we all know that.\"\n  \n", "\n\n  KOLKATA: He wants to finish games like he did for the Kolkata Knight Riders against Delhi Daredevils but Yusuf Pathan won't change his flamboyant style of batsmanship.\n  \n\n  \"There was a lot of pressure I just wanted to play my natural game. You will always get out at some point, be it in the first ball or in the 40th ball. But it's about playing my shots and making the balls count,\" Pathan told PTI during an interview.\n  \n\n  On his own admission, Pathan feels that he is a special talent, who need not to compete with anyone but focus on his own game.\n  \n\n  \"Everyone has some special talents, and I am also special in my way. I don't want to compete with anyone. I want to prove myself with my performance on the field,\" Pathan said with a lot of conviction.\n  \n\n  So does he harbour hopes of an India comeback with so many ahead of him for those couple of slots in the middle- order?\n  \n\n  \"It does not matter to me who's ahead of me (in representing India). I consider myself as a special talent,\" Pathan said.\n  \n\n  Having scored 39-ball 59 against Delhi Daredevils, the India discard proved why he is so highly rated in the Kolkata Knight Riders ranks despite his game-changing knocks being few and far in between.\n  \n\n  \"I have to back my talent. It does not take time for things to change. If I continue to perform well, at some point I will get an opportunity if not today then tomorrow,\" Pathan seemed positive that he may once again don the India blues.\n  \n\n  \"I don't want to look at others. My job is to play good cricket and the start has been good this time. I should be satisfied with my cricket and be prepared whenever I get a chance,\" he said.\n  \n\n  Pathan has had his share of disappointment with the team especially during their maiden title-winning campaign in 2012 when he managed just 194 in 17 matches without a single half- century but the Shah Rukh Khan co-owned franchise has backed him throughout these years.\n  \n\n  In fact, his 112 matches since 2011 is one more than skipper Gautam Gambhir's 111 games for the popular Kolkata franchise.\n  \n\n  \"The only message from Shah Rukh Khan, continue to entertain the way you have been,\" Pathan said.\n  \n\n  Pathan refused to agree his style has changed but says he's keen to finish off games now.\n  \n\n  \"Having played for so long, you are aware of your team's strength. If you are set, it's all about finishing the game. It's about setting a precedent for the youngsters in the team as well. They should also get an opportunity to learn. It's about winning comfortably.\"\n  \n\n  Pathan believes that as long as he is at the crease, KKR can win matches.\n  \n\n  \"I think as long as I am at the crease, the team will win comfortably. In the past, I have seen the team has gone on to lose the match after I got out. All these things, I have brought some changes in my game. It's about playing shots.\"\n  \n\n  At this stage of his career, Pathan only wants to enjoy his cricket.\n  \n\n  \"I just want to enjoy my cricket. If you see in the last game, I've started playing shots from the very second ball. My style has not changed, it is just that I want to make sure that I take the team through till end. This is the only change,\" he said.\n  \n\n  Pathan credited chief coach Jacques Kallis and his deputy Simon Katich for bringing a balance in the team, which is leading the table with four wins from five matches.\n  \n\n  \"The credit goes to Katich and Kallis. They have put on a lot of hard work. They have put a clear picture on every player's mind. Everyone knows their role well. If you play well result will come your way.\"\n  \n\n  Pathan also hailed the Kolkata crowd for turning up in huge numbers in every game.\n  \n\n  \"It was heartening to see packed crowd from the very first match. In previous seasons, there would be many empty seats in the initial phase but now it's all packed up. Such an excitement among the crowd is really motivating to do even better,\" he signed off.\n  \n\n", "\n\n  BARCELONA: A distraught Neymar left the field in tears as Juventus held Barcelona to a 0-0 draw at the Camp Nou on Wednesday to reach the Champions League semi-finals 3-0 on aggregate.\n  \n\n  Barca had overcome a 4-0 first-leg deficit against Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16 with a dramatic 6-1 win back on home soil.\n  \n\n  But Juventus showed why they boast the best defensive record in the competition as Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar were blunted as the Italians gained revenge for their defeat in the 2015 Champions League final.\n  \n\n  \"To not concede a goal in two games against Barcelona says a lot about the tactical level of the team,\" said Juventus boss Massimiliano Allegri.\n  \n\n  \"They had more chances in Turin than they did tonight.

After he put together scores of 32, 6 and 22 in three out of the five games that the RCB played this season, the \"Universe Boss\" needed only three to reach the unique, unbelievable landmark, but the big Jamaican wasn't sure of a place in the XI when his team took on the Gujarat Lions at the SCA Stadium here on Wednesday night.\n  \n\n  History, however, is often built on mishaps. On the eve of the game, Bangalore suffered a big blow when AB de Villiers was ruled out due to a back injury. It meant Gayle had the chance to cross the rare milestone, which was now in his sniffing distance, and the ever-smiling Caribbean wasn't going to miss out.\n  \n\n  He got to the 10,000-run mark in singles, and then celebrated the occasion in grand style. Exploding like only he can, the 37-year-old smoked seven huge sixes and five fours while blasting 77 of 38 balls to show how he's still the \"biggest weapon of mass destruction\" in this format.\n  \n\n  Riding on his blazing return to form, RCB devoured the Lions in their own den and raced away to 213 for two, the highest score in IPL 2017 so far, after being put in. Fired by a brilliant, fighting 72 (7x6, 2x4) from Kiwi great Brendon McCullum, Gujarat were later provided a faint hope by talented youngster Ishan Kishan (39, 16b, 2x4, 4x6), who came up with some lusty blows towards the end, but the hosts eventually fell short by 21 runs to finish at 192 for seven in a high-scoring game.\n  \n\n  The win ended RCB's unwanted sequence of three defeats on the trot and move up from the bottom of the table, while ironically pushing the Lions to the last spot.\n  \n\n  Before he was finally out lbw to a Basil Thampi yorker, Gayle added 122 for the first wicket with skipper Virat Kohli, who seemed content to enjoy the 'Gayle storm' from the best seat in the house the nonstriker's end.\n  \n\n  Later, Kedar Jadhav (38,16b, 5x4, 2x6), and Travis Head (30, 16b, 2x4, 1x6) added 54 in 25 balls to provide the ideal finishing touches to the RCB innings, while showing that the visitors meant business. Nothing, though, came near to the kind of entertainment Gayle dished out.\n  \n\n  At one point, though, the 'Gayle Show' threated to get over just when it was in full flow. The left-hander looked like he was stunningly caught at the long off boundary by a diving McCullum, before replays suggested that the Kiwi's floppy hat may have touched the rope while taking the catch.\n  \n\n  It ultimately turned out to be the final six of a Ravindra Jadeja over in which the left-arm spinner ended up being thrashed for 4,4,6 and 6 off his final four balls by the Gayle.\n  \n\n  The India all-rounder seems to be struggling to find his form in the IPL. Bowling too flat and fast, he ended up conceding 57 runs off four overs. The all-rounder's miserable night was complete when he was run out in a mix-up with Kishan.\n  \n\n", "\n\n  Fantastic display of batting prowess by Mumbai Indians helped them register a thumping eight-wicket victory over Kings XI Punjab in Match 22 of the Indian Premier League season 10 at the Holkar Stadium, Indore on Thursday. MI chased down a target of 199 with over four overs remaining. Jos Buttler (77) and Parthiv Patel (37) started the assault helping Mumbai to their best ever powerplay score (82/1) before Nitish Rana joined the fray with a 34-ball 62-run knock. KXIP bowling was lacklustre and they failed to carry on the good work done by the batsmen, Hashim Amla in particular, who scored a brilliant 104 not out off 60 balls that helped KXIP post 198 for four.\n  \n\n  We breakdown the match in five:\n  \n\nAmla, Marsh start off well\n\n\n  Playing his first game of the season at the expense of an unwell Manan Vohra, Shaun Marsh showed glimpses of his immaculate strokeplay cracking five boundaries en route to 26 off just 21 balls. Hashim Amla was slow to start but picked up the pace cracking Lasith Malinga for a six. When Marsh was scalped by Mitchell McClenaghan in the sixth over, KXIP had scored 46. Wriddhiman Saha, who came to bat at number three failed to get going and was picked up by Krunal Pandya for 10 off 15 balls. Amla by that time had moved on to 40 off 30 deliveries.\n  \n\nMaxwell goes bonkers\n\n\n  Fall of Saha brought to the crease KXIP skipper Glenn Maxwell and the Australian started off well taking two consecutive boundaries off Jasprit Bumrah to make his intentions clear. Off the 16th over, bowled by McClenaghan, Maxwell went on an all out assault with three sixes and two fours, taking 28 runs off the over - second-most expensive over of the season. Amla then upped the ante taking Malinga to the cleaners with two sixes and two fours helping himself to a 34-ball 50 in the process.\n  \n\nAmla finishes off in style\n\n\n  Maxwell was undone by a slower one from Bumrah, but Amla had his eyes set for a final flourish and the South African hit Malinga for two sixes in the final over. He reached his first triple-figure mark in the format off just 58 balls - more importantly he accelerated well taking only 24 balls to go from 50 to 100. KXIP ended with 198/4\n  \n\nParthiv, Buttler put KXIP bowlers to the sword\n\n\n  In reply, Mumbai had to start well and Jos Buttler ensured that hitting Sandeep Sharma for a six in the first over. Ishant was meted out with a similar treatment with Buttler taking him for two fours in the second over. Runs continued to flow as Ishant Sharma went on to concede 17 runs off his second over while Sandeep Sharma leaked 13. Maxwell threw the ball to the third Sharma, Mohit, and he too was taken to the cleaners by Parthiv. By the end of powerplay overs, Mumbai had posted 82 for 1 - their best powerplay score in IPL. Parthiv was undone by a slower one from Marcus Stoinis and departed for 37.\n  \n\nRana adds finishing touches\n\n\n  Buttler continued his assault and finally managed to convert his good start in to something substantial. With powerful strikes down the ground and spectacular aerial shots, Buttler reached his half-century off just 24 balls, striking the ball at 208.3. One down Nitish Rana then got in to the act with a six off Axar Patel. By the end of 10 overs, Mumbai had scored 123/1, their best ever score at the halfway mark. Whatever bowling changes Maxwell made didn't work as Rana and Buttler put every KXIP bowler to the sword. Buttler perished to Mohit Sharma but not before registering his highest T20 score. Rana and Hardik Pandya (15) then added the finishing touches with Rana scoring his third fifty of the season and he went on to regain the Orange Cap. Mumbai overhauled the target with eight wickets in hand and 27 balls to spare.\n  \n\n", "\n\n  NEW DELHI: In his comeback to competitive badminton after a three-month absence, 2014 Commonwealth Games gold medalist Parupalli Kashyap has beaten Thailand's Suppanyu Avihingsanon 21-16, 21-17 to enter the last 16 of the 2017 China Grand Prix Gold.\n  \n\n  Kashyap, whose men's singles ranking has fallen to 104 in the time that he was forced out of action owing to a knee injury sustained earlier this year, took the lead in the first game before his opponent leveled the scores briefly at 15-15, but Kashyap pulled away to take it 21-16.\n  \n\n  In the second game, Avihingsanon led 14-12 before Kashyap fought back to make it 18-13, which then became 18-17 as a heated encounter intensified.
