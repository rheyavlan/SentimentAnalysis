The technique could also be adapted to other organs, allowing hearts, lungs and kidneys to be grown inside the body to replace parts worn by age or damaged by disease, the Daily Telegraph reported on Tuesday.", "\nAre the rising swine flu casualties giving you jitters? Not sure how you can avoid falling prey to the growing epidemic? First and foremost, there is absolutely no need to panic.\n\n\n  Here are some easy steps you can take to tackle a flu virus of any kind, including swine flu. It is not necessary to follow all the steps at once. You can pick and choose a combination of remedies that suit you best. However, if you are already suffering from flu, these measures can help only up to an extent.\n  \n\n  1. Have five duly washed leaves of Tulsi (known as Basil in English; medicinal name Ocimum sanctum) everyday in the morning. Tulsi has a large number of therapeutic properties. It keeps throat and lungs clear and helps in infections by way of strengthening your immunity.\n  \n\n  2. Giloi (medicinal name Tinospora cordifolia) is a commonly available plant in many areas. Take a one-foot long branch of giloi, add five to six leaves of Tulsi and boil in water for 15-20 minutes or long enough to allow the water to extract its properties. Add black pepper and sendha (salt used during religious fasts), rock or black salt, or Misri (crystalised sugar like lumps to make it sweet) according to taste. Let it cool a bit and drink this kadha (concoction) while still warm. It will work wonders for your immunity. If giloi plant is not available, get processed giloi powder from Hamdard or others, and concoct a similar drink once a day.\n  \n\n  3. A small piece of camphor (kapoor) approximately the size of a tablet should be taken once or twice a month. It can be swallowed with water by adults while children can take it along with mashed potatoes or banana because they will find it difficult to have it without any aides. Please remember camphor is not to be taken everyday, but only once each season, or once a month.\n  \n\n  4. Those who can take garlic, must have two pods of raw garlic first thing in the morning. To be swallowed daily with lukewarm water. Garlic too strengthens immunity like the earlier measures mentioned.\n  \n\n  5. Those not allergic to milk, must take a glass of hot or lukewarm milk every night with a small measure of haldi (turmeric).\n  \n\n  6. Aloe vera (gwarpatha) too is a commonly available plant. Its thick and long, cactus-like leaves have an odourless gel. A teaspoon gel taken with water daily can work wonders for not only your skin and joint pains, but also boost immunity.\n  \n\n  7. Take homeopathic medicines \u2014 Pyrogenium 200 and Inflenzium 200 in particular \u2014 five tablets three times a day, or two-three drops three times a day. While these are not specifically targeted at H1N1 either, these work well as preventive against common flu virus.\n  \n\n  8. Do Pranayam daily (preferably under guidance if you are already not initiated into it) and go for morning jog/walk regularly to keep your throat and lungs in good condition and body in fine fettle. Even in small measures, it will work wonders for your body's resistance against all such diseases which attack the nose, throat and lungs, besides keeping you fit.\n  \n\n  9. Have citrus fruits, particularly Vitamin C rich Amla (Indian gooseberry) juice. Since fresh Amla is not yet available in the market (not for another three to four months), it is not a bad idea to buy packaged Amla juice which is commonly available nowadays.\n  \n\n  10. Last but not the least, wash your hands frequently every day with soap and warm water for 15-20 seconds; especially before meals, or each time after touching a surface that you suspect could be contaminated with flu virus such as a door handle or a knob/handle, especially if you have returned from a public place or used public transport. Alcohol-based hand cleaners should be kept handy at all times and used until you can get soap and warm water.\n  \n\n  (The author is an avid reader and follower of alternative therapies including spiritual healing, ayurveda, yoga and homeopathy)\n  \n\n\n", "MELBOURNE: If you think a kiss is just a kiss, you might want to think again, for the simple pleasure now comes with a health warning-it can cause herpes. The Australian Herpes Management Forum, which is to start an awareness campaign, has warned that a kiss is a major transmitter of herpes. The symbol of affection \"poses risks to both adults and children\". \"No parent kissing their child or partner kissing their girlfriend wants to pass along the Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), but people should be aware this is the main method of transmission. Once you have been infected with HSV-1 or HSV-2, the virus stays in your body for life and can reactivate at any time,\" the Australian media quoted AHMF's Executive Director Tricia Berger. \"If you have a herpes sore on or near your mouth, it is likely that you'll pass the virus along to whomever you kiss. It is also possible to transmit the virus even when there are no apparent sores or symptoms, but the risk is higher when the sores are visible,\" Berger said. HSV-1 is the variant of the virus otherwise referred to as cold sores. It is commonly acquired as a child from contact, often a kiss, with adult relatives. Berger said the herpes risk posed by kissing would be the main theme of a new community service awareness campaign. Television and radio ads will be aired nationally from August up to National Herpes Awareness Day, in October.

If the clot breaks free and moves through the bloodstream, it can lodge in lungs, a condition known as pulmonary embolism which is often fatal.\n      \n\n      Treating blood clots with syringes after joint surgery is painful and can cause bleeding. Now, an international team has found a better way of preventing deadly blood clots without increasing the risk of bleeding, the 'New England Journal of Medicine' reported.\n      \n\n      In a double blind study of more than 3,000 patients, researchers tested a new type of anti-clotting drug called Apixaban, which is an oral medication.

The study suggests that if you want to settle down, your chances of getting married or living with someone are probably highest in Britain, the Scandinavian countries and the United States, where men more likely than their Australian counterparts to do the household chores and thereby make marriage a more attractive option to their nations' women. According to an Oxford economist, marriage and cohabiting rates in developed countries can be linked to attitudes towards the roles of men and women, and views on who is responsible for doing the housework and looking after the children. Both men and women have shown they are more likely to want a live-in relationship with the opposite sex if they think their partner will do a share of the housework and childcare duties.

Dialing a cell phone and using or reaching for an electronic device while driving increased risk of collision about six times in cars and trucks, the study said. Recent research using driving simulators suggested that talking and listening were as dangerous as texting, but the \"naturalistic driving studies clearly indicate that this is not the case,\" the local media quoted a release from the institute as saying. \"The risks of texting generally applied to all drivers, not just truckers,\" the researchers said.

Fuelling the alarming trend is the rise in diabetes prevalence in rural areas.The unexpected surge has forced the Diabetes Atlas, a global report on the disorder, to plan a revision of the India-specific numbers in October. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdA recent study we did in Chennai and Kancheepuram shows an increase in prevalence of 40% in urban areas in six years, and 49% in rural areas in three years. This proves the general hypothesis of diabetes affecting more urbanites than rural people wrong,\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd says Indian Diabetes Research Foundation president Dr A Ramachandran.According to Diabetes Atlas published in 2007, there are 246 million diabetics across the world, with 80% of them in the developing and underdeveloped countries. India, according to these statistics, has 40.9 million diabetics, closely followed by China with 39.8 million diabetics. It was predicted that by 2025, India will have 69.9 million people and China will have 59.3 million people with diabetics.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdWhen the atlas was released, the hypothesis was that the prevalence in cities was higher than in rural areas.

That will help us revise the policies and strategies to battle diabetes,\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd says Ramachandran, who is to be part of the committee working out the revised data.The shift, according to Endocrine Diagnostic Centre and Diabetes Care Centre medical director Dr S Murthy, is possibly because of the urbanisation of rural areas. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdChanging lifestyles and gentic factors lead to metabolic disorders,\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd he says.

The bad news: breast cancer cases have shot up alarmingly, across the country.A landmark analysis of cancer cases in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Bangalore between 1982-2005 (24 years) by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has found that while cervical cancer cases dipped, in some cases by almost 50%, the incidence of breast cancer doubled. And, the trends contained in ICMR's yet-to-be-released report `Time Trends in Cancer Incidence Rates (1982-2005)', were universal in all four cities.In case of cervical cancer, this is how the cases have dropped: In 1982, Bangalore reported 32.4 new cases of cervical cancer in women per 100,000 population every year. The number dipped to 27.2 in 1991, 17 in 2001 and 18.2 in 2005.Delhi, whose records are available from 1988, saw 25.9 new cases of cervical cancer per 100,000 population the same year. It then dipped to 19.1 in 1998 and then to 18.9 in 2005.Mumbai, which recorded 17.9 new cases of cervical cancer per 100,000 population in 1982, recorded 12.7 new cases in 2005.Chennai recorded a fall of almost 50% in cases of cervical cancer in this period of 24 years. In 1982, Chennai recorded 41 cases per 100,000 population; nearly a decade later, in 1991, Chennai's figure of new cases dipped to 33.4. In 2005, new cases fell further to 22 per 100,000 population.Caused by the Human Papiloma Virus (HPV), cervical cancer is often called the poor woman's disease. It was earlier believed that cervical cancer was most common in India, with more than 1.3 lakh new cases reported each year and 74,000 women dying annually from the disease.While Bangalore saw breast cancer cases more than double since 1982 - 15.8 in a population of one lakh in 1982 to 32.2 in 2005 - Chennai recorded 33.5 new cases of breast cancer in 2005 against 18.4 in 1982.Delhi recorded 24.8 new cases of breast cancer a year per 100,000 women which rose to 32.2 in 2005. Mumbai recorded 20.8 new cases of breast cancer per 100,000 population in 1982 which increased by almost 10% in 2005.ICMR director general and secretary of the department of health research Dr V M Katoch told TOI, ``The decline in cases of cancer cervix has been seen across all cancer registries. Factors like late age of marriage and fewer children could be responsible for the decline.''Chief of medical oncology at AIIMS and head of the Delhi Cancer Registry Dr Vinod Raina told TOI, ``Increasing number of women are now delivering in institutions which has greatly improved their personal hygiene. Women now marry late and give birth to fewer children, all of which have led to a dip in cervical cancer cases.''Ironically, these are the same factors, according to Dr Raina, which has increased breast cancer rates in India. ``Western lifestyle, increased consumption of fat products, obesity, late marriages, delayed child bearing and less number of children being conceived leading to reduced breastfeeding and use of some contraceptives, are all believed to be behind this increased risk of breast cancer. This cancer is also inevitable with an ageing population,'' he added.Dr Raina, however, was quick to say that breast cancer rate in India was much less than that in the West which records around 100 new cases per 100,000 population every year.According to Dr Katoch, the report depicts changes in the incidence rates of cancer and is the first for any chronic disease in India.Certain anatomical sites of cancer have shown a significantly steady increase across all registries, breast cancer being one of them. ``This data will now help galvanize India's health system and tell us how we can improve diagnostic capabilities and specialists in some types of cancer affecting Indians most,'' Dr Katoch said.", "CHENNAI: Why is every alternate person in rural India above the age of 40 blinded by cataract when only one in five in cities has the disease? This was the question that troubled a group of researchers at Sankara Nethralaya in the city nearly two years ago. Today, they have an answer exposure to ultraviolet radiation. The team, comprising optometrists and ophthalmologists, found that though the level of ultraviolet radiation was higher in Chennai than in neighbouring Tiruvallur due to pollution, ocular exposure to these rays was higher in the rural areas than in the city, increasing the risk. \"Our study shows that it's clearly because of the lifestyle changes most city residents have adopted,\" said Dr Ronnie George, consultant, Sankara Nethralaya. Screening the profiles of over 800 people equally divided in urban and rural areas the team calculated \"the lifetime ocular UV exposure\" in rural and urban areas. \"The study proved that no matter where they are or what they do agriculture, poultry or construction labour hats and/or sunglasses are required to block ultraviolet rays from the eye. It has got to do more with common sense than style,\" he said. Arivunidhi K, 47, an agricultural labourer who was operated for cataract in June, understands this very well. \"Almost every working member of my family has disease. It progressed faster in my wife and she was operated last year,\" he said. While Arivunidhi and his wife Kalaiselvi are among the few lucky ones, many aren't. A cataract is a clouding of the lens. India is now home to more than 15 million blind, the bulk of which is due to cataract and therefore reversible. A recent study on cataract conducted by the hospital, in which 7,774 patients were screened, showed that nearly 50% of rural citizens above 40 years were affected. In the urban areas, nearly 20% were affected. Cataracts are classified according to where they occur. The cataract linked to ultraviolet exposure is the cortical cataract and forms in the outer layer of the lens. People with higher lifetime ocular exposure were more at risk for this type of cataract than those with the lowest exposure. Lifetime ocular exposure is calculated with formulae the scientists developed based on an individual's case history, including profession, hours of stay in the sun and place of residence. The hospital sourced the dosage of ultraviolet radiation from Tropospheric Emission Monitoring Systems. According to the international initiative that studies ozone depletion, the UV index in Tiruvallur was 6.9 and in Chennai 7.1. Since January, the team also measured the extent of ultraviolet radiation in Chennai and the neighbouring districts. \"We exposed polysulfone strips, which are capable of absorbing the UV flux from sunlight, and then read the measurement under a collimator, a device that narrows a beam of particles or waves. The gap between the city and the rural areas was evident in this as well,\" said Rashima Asokan, an optometrist. Studies have shown that extensive exposure to sunlight, particularly ultraviolet B radiation, could increase the risk of a major form of cataracts, besides skin cancer. UV-A radiation is more associated with tanning of the skin. Going by the radiation level, Chennai should have been at a greater risk. \"'We looked at the wherefore, not the why,\" Dr George said. The analysis gave the answers. The lifetime ocular exposure for an urbanite was 1.32 against 3.16 for those in the rural areas. That clearly explained why people in rural areas got the disease at least five years earlier than their counterparts in the city or why the incidence was more than double. \"Where there is enough sun to give sunburns, it's only wise to block the sun. If glasses are not affordable, we would prescribe at least a hat,\" said Rashima. "]
